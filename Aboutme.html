  <p>Hello there, my name is Isaiah. I'm a graphic designer based in Winter Springs, FL, currently attending F.I.R.S.T Institute. I will be graduating with my Graphic Design & Web Development diploma in November 2021. From there, I plan to have to do work as a freelancer and inspire my audience. Fun fact, I'm a huge Marvel fan and always have been since I was a kid, which is where my passion for creating comes from. Creating Illustrations, Concepts, and posters for their brand is a future goal of mine and something I love to do currently for fun.</p>
